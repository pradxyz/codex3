# Sudoku Solving Algorithm in C++

## Description
This program solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It takes a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid as input and fills in the empty cells (denoted by 0) to complete the puzzle. The solution ensures that all rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids contain unique digits from 1 to 9.

---

## Features
- Solves any valid Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
- Validates the initial puzzle for correctness.
- Displays the solved puzzle in a user-friendly format.

---

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming.
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC, or Clang).

---

## How to Use

### Steps to Run the Program
1. Save the program as `sudoku_solver.cpp`.
2. Open a terminal or IDE.
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -o sudoku_solver sudoku_solver.cpp
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./sudoku_solver
   ```

5. Provide a Sudoku puzzle as input in a 9x9 grid format (use `0` for empty cells).

6. View the solved puzzle output.

## Input Format
- A 9x9 grid of integers.
- Example of input:
  ```
  5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
  6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
  0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
  8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
  4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1
  7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6
  0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0
  0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5
  0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9
  ```
